# median_filter_VHDL
This is a project I was doing at the Faculty. The subject is VLSI Systems Design. The task is to implement picture from memory and send the pixels on PC. Using Python script the picture is transfered. The picture that is transfering has noise, and the goal is to filter the picture usin median filtering method.
